Implementing OOP, MVC, Exception handling, and version control to the program, making a well-structured program, and 
aids in organizing the application into distinct sections for easier development and testing programs.

# Challenge_3
SYNRGY Challenge Chapter 3

Implements features using Lambda expressions, Optional, and Stream API to ensure concise, readable, and efficient code. This transformation enhances readability and optimizes the program's performance, ensuring seamless execution and functionality. This version introduced unit testing to validate the program's reliability and robustness. This strategic addition is instrumental in verifying each part of the software by isolating it and proving its correctness, efficiency, and reliability, assuring the quality and dependability of the application. I also provided ERD with a comprehensive DDL. This meticulously crafted DDL serves as the foundational structure of the database.

# Challenge_4
SYNRGY Challenge Chapter 4

Implementing a database to store the restaurant's menu and orders, ensuring data persistence and scalability. This version also includes a RESTful API to interact with the database, enabling users to perform CRUD operations on the menu and orders. The API provides a seamless interface for users to access and manipulate the data, enhancing the application's functionality and usability. This version also includes integration testing to validate the API's functionality and ensure its reliability and robustness. Integration testing is crucial in verifying the API's interactions with the database and ensuring that it performs as expected, providing users with a dependable and efficient system.

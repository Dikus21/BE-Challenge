Implements features using Lambda expressions, Optional, and Stream API to ensure concise, readable, and efficient code. This transformation enhances readability and optimizes the program's performance, ensuring seamless execution and functionality. This version introduced unit testing to validate the program's reliability and robustness. This strategic addition is instrumental in verifying each part of the software by isolating it and proving its correctness, efficiency, and reliability, assuring the quality and dependability of the application. I also provided ERD with a comprehensive DDL. This meticulously crafted DDL serves as the foundational structure of the database.
